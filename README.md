## Description

Small Business Site
Your work with Mario's Specialty Foods has led to some great word of mouth publicity and you've been offered several freelance development jobs! Today your goal is to create the most professional site you can. Yes, that's a bit vague... but your clients aren't quite sure what they want. However, they'll know it when they see it.

Contract Options

Each of the following small businesses have requested your services. Choose one to work with today:

Son of Cod Seafood, a local seafood company.
Craftsy, an online store that sells artisan handmade crafts and other artisan goods.
Bon App√©tizers, a catering site that offers different catering packages and dishes for events.
Miles of Smiles, a photographer that offers different packages for family, wedding, engagement, etc. photo shoots.
Any other company of your own creation, as long as requirements below are met.
Authentication and Authorization

The company has decided their site requires two types of accounts: basic user accounts, and administrator accounts.
Basic users must be able to leave reviews on products/services (more info below).
Only administrators will have the option to add, edit, or delete products/services, and delete user reviews.
Landing Page

The site needs a visually-appealing landing page with a welcome message, and basic information about the company.
It should include navigation options for users to make their way around the site (including the login page) too.
Products/Services Page

It also needs an area where users may view all products or services they offer.
Admins must have an option to add new products/services.
At the very least, each product/service should include a name, description, and price. But you're encouraged to add more properties specific to the product/service your site offers.
Detail Page

All users should be able to click an individual product's entry to view that particular product or service's detail page.
The detail page should include all product/service details, including its image.
Authenticated basic users should have an option to leave a comment or review about a product.
Administrators should have the option to edit or delete any service or product.
Administrators should also have the option to delete inappropriate user reviews or comments.
Further Exploration
If you finish meeting the objectives for this project, consider implementing additional features, such as:

Aim for 100% SimpleCov coverage, instead of 80%.
Allow admins to to upload images to associate with each product/service using Paperclip.
Add functionality to send users a welcome email when they register for an account.
Allow admins to create Categorys. Each product/service should belong to a Category, and users should be able to select different categories to see their products/services. You may choose whether products/services may belong to many Categorys, or only one.
Use CanCanCan to manage authorizing Administrator accounts.
Implement ActiveAdmin to create an administrator dashboard.
Allow users to add products/services to a shopping cart, and go through a "checkout" process to receive a total and a receipt. (We will be adding a shopping cart to applications next week.)
